# The Color Game

This is a small RGB color guessing game which is useful for practicing RGB colors. We get six random color boxes when we load up the page, which are always different. One of those colors is listed in RGB color system at the top of the page. Our job is to pick that color from the given six random colors. 
If you click on the wrong answer, that color box will disappear. However, if you click on the right answer, all six color boxes come back with the correct color. And the background color changes to the correct color as well.
Users have the option to choose new colors to test their knowledge, moreover, they can also  switch between Easy and Hard mode. Easy mode has three random color boxes while the Hard mode has six random color boxes.
